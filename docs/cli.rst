Command Line Interface
======================

The command line interface includes two tools: ``pbs``
(**P**\ ro\ **B**\ oards **S**\ craper), the tool used to actually scrape
a forum or part of a forum, and ``pbd``
(**P**\ ro\ **B**\ oards Scraper **D**\ atabase utility), a tool used to
perform simple queries on a database file. The database tool provides a
convenient way to view select contents of the database presented in a
readable manner, though it lacks the ability to perform complex queries and
does not exhaustively show all information in the database.
